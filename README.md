# hello-world
trial repository
This is my trial change to find out how changes are committed. Humour is not my forte and clerical work might be more 'my kind of work'. Nevertheless, I enjoy debugging. I think I am better at debugging than actual programming from scratch. After all, is it not more fun to point out other's mistakes ;) :D

My interests are weird! What can I say, I am differnt :D
